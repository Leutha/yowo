He came down from Highgate thro' Hackney & Holloway towards London
Till he came to old Stratford, & thence to Stepney & the Isle
Of Leutha's Dogs, thence thro' the narrows of the River's side,

The kennels of the streets and lanes as if they were abhorr'd
Every Universal Form was become barren mountains of moral
Virtue, and every Minute Particular harden'd into grains of sand
And all the tendernesses of the soul cast forth as filth and mire.
